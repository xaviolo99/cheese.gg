Main database clarifications:

Allies (columns with an A) are always the blue side (team 100).
Enemies (columns with a E) are always the red side (team 200).

The win column is 1 if the allies or blue side won and 0 otherwise.

The first 5 champions are allies and the last or following 5 enemies.

All deltas are multiplied by 100 to save space.
