The performance is good, but cant improve more than this.

I seem to not be overfitting with this parameters (train and validation loss are similar)
So maybe adding more parameters would help. This is thanks to that we have a lot of data (15MB) which makes overfitting really difficult.
No dropout needed yet, but if augmenting the neurons we start seeing clear signs of overfitting, we can start to add.
